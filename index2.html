    <h1>Daniel's Introduction</h1>
        <p> I'm taking this class because I want to apply the coding I've done in CS I and II. I am interested in coding and would like to pick up more skills.</p>

    <h2> Daniel's Hobbies / Interests</h2>

        <h3>Tennis</h3>
            <p>I like to play tennis. I played in high school, but the season was cut short due to COVID which was disappointing. Now I just do it for fun, I don't play
                for MCC.

        <h3>Video games</h3>
            <p>I like playing videogames. Recently I have been playing Age of Empires and Overwatch. It's something relaxing that is fun to play after a long day.</p>

        <h3>Geography</h3>
            <p>An interest of mine is geography. I really like maps and reading about geopolitics. I intend on majoring in it at NIU.</p>
